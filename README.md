"Attentive Diagnostics" is the culmination of a rigorous investigation into advancing the field of medical diagnostics through artificial intelligence. This project's centerpiece is the novel integration of attention mechanisms with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), synergized with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to enhance diagnostic accuracy in analyzing chest X-rays (CXRs).

### Abstract
Chest X-rays are pivotal in diagnosing various thoracic diseases. However, their interpretation can be complex and error-prone. Leveraging recent strides in AI, this project introduces a methodical approach to refining the diagnosis process. By combining CNNs with attention mechanisms and SVM classification, this project sets out to create an efficient, AI-assisted method for medical image analysis.

### Datasets
This project utilizes extensive dataset of the NIH ChestX-ray14.

### Implementation
The project consists of several phases, each dedicated to different facets of model developmentâ€”from prototype models using basic CNN architectures to the sophisticated integration of ResNet-18 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Evaluation strategies are meticulously devised, prioritizing AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, and F-1 scores.

#### Supported Models:

- The final model is located here: [Baseline Model Notebook](models/Baseline%20Final/Baseline.ipynb)
- For an end-to-end data to model example, see: [ResNet-18 CBAM Notebook](models/Resnet-18-CBAM/Resnet-18-CBAM.ipynb)
